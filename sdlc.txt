Software Development Life Cycle :
- it is the complete process of buliding a industury level software

Process involve in SDLC :
1. Planning and Requirements Analysis
this process focuses on the following parameters

- costs required to develop a software
- team members with their responsibiliy
- end user of the product
- features of the product
- product feasibility
- and finally software requirement specification document is developed and SRS must be follwed throughout the development process

2. Designing a solution :
- now based on the customer requirements a solution is designed
- here different approach is follwed and different solution is created
- and finally the well optimized solution is choosen

3. Coding
- programming language is choosen according to the solution
- and solution is implemented in coding using programming language

4. Testing 
- most important process
- here different inputs is given to product and output is checked
- if there is any bugs then it is fixed
- now product is ready

5. Deployment 
- after product is ready it's first version is released
- after the feedback of users then final version is released in the market

6. Maintenance
- unknown problem may arise while using the product so this is fixed
- new features is added
- checking of product whether it is working properly or not on the different platform
